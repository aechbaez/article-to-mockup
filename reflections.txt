You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

So far I've learned the basics of HTML syntax and the uses for some different elements. It's only some basic formatting but I think it's pretty neat the way everything cleans up when I add the tags and change things around.
So far mostly everything has bee relatively easy, but maybe that's due to my programming background.
I do  have to admit that I sometimes have a little bit of trouble remembering the syntax for links.
The strategies from the first project have helped in the way that I'm trying to see this as a process. Not thinking that I just know the stuff and being mindful of the fact that reviewing material never killed anyone.. I think.
